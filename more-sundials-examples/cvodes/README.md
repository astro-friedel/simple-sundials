## What is CVODES?

CVODES is a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems (initial value problem) given in explicit form yâ€™ = f(t,y,p) with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint modes).

CVODES is a superset of CVODE and hence all options available to CVODE (with the exception of the FCVODE interface module) are also available for CVODES.

## Where do I get the CVODES package?

To download the libraries go to their software download page:

 - https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software

Appendix A of the CVODE guide gives a pretty good tutorial of how to download, install, and configure the all sundials libraries for use depending on the OS you're currently using.

*Note: The instructions above tell the user to change the generate settings for the install prefix to /usr/casc/sundials/instdir but for the GenericMakeFile it is more simple to leave the ccmake settings as is and keep the generate settings for the install prefix as the default option:

```
/usr/local
```
